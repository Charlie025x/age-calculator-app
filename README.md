## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React Form library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Typescript ](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript

### What I learned

This is my first project where I utilized Typescript. I started the project confident as I declared my types, but I eventually ran into 'type may potentialy be undefined' errors. That error had be spinning my gears but I pulled through with conditional type checks. I also got to refresh myself on the React Hook Form libary, a great tool for building forms in React.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing Typescript. I'm almost certain I will be hating this decision when I'm fighting typescript errors in the future, but I know it will help me build skills that will easily transfer to other programming language. While I was developing with React-Hook-Form I learned of a tool called Zod that pairs well with React-Hook-Form and alows for a better authentication expirence when writing forms. I'd like to try Zod in the near future.

### Useful resources

- [React Hook Form Tutorials | Codevolution](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjmgBr1327BA5bVXoQH-w5s&si=CKVyDrt2K5rPt3_D) - This YouTube playlist contains video tutorials on React-Hook-Form. React Hook Form is a npm package that makes working with Forms a little easier on a React envirnment. This playlist is great for teaching the ins and outs of the package, it especialy helped me with form error and state handleing.
